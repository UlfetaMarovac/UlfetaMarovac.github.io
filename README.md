# Homepage of Ulfeta Marovac
My research interests can be divided into three fields: logic, text mining, and bioinformatics. Sometimes the aims of these fields are overlapping. My recent researches from logic are about solving some of the special cases of the system of generalized systems of Boolean equations. The obtained results in logic were very useful for my thesis “Mining sequential patterns for determination of protein characteristics”. The thesis proposed the model for classification of proteins in COG categories based on amino acid n-grams (sequences of n- length). The methods which are using in data mining biological sequences can be used for processing natural language; therefore my present researches concern the processing of texts written in Serbian.  So, my research interests focus on, biological sequences analysis, text mining, natural language processing, logic and its applications in computer science.
